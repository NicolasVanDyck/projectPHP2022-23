## Subject:
The client requested an application for her father's cycling club.
Main goal of this app is to improve communication between members, therefore it will primarily be used as a platform:
    - for admins to centralize information about the club.
    - to inform members about upcoming events/tours.
    - for members to sign in or out from upcoming events/tours.
    - for outsiders to be able to contact the club over the internet.
It will also be used as a platform :
    - where members can up- and download tours to ride on their own.
    - where members can order club clothing and admins can take a look at the orders.

## Team members:
